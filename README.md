# Weather Wanderer

## Summary

This site serves as a weather forecast application It dispays both the current weather, including date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, and an icon depicting the current weather condition, and a 5-day forecast, including the date, temperature, humidity, and the same icon depicting weather conditions. The UV Index is given a background color depending on the value of the UV index, green signifying a low UV index, yellow signifying medium, orange signifying high, red signifying very high, and purple signifying extremely high. The user can lookup the weather forecast for any city, state, or country using the search bar. All searches are saved under the search bar in "Search History" so that the user may return to previously viewed forecasts. Searched are also stored in local storage so that the user's search history persist each time the application is opened in the browser.

This site is responsive to ensure that the site renders well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
